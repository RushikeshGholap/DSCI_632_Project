# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project was developed as part of the coursework for the DSCI 632 Applied Cloud Computing course. The aim of the project is to utilize machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on their medical history and demographic details.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the "diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv" dataset, which contains medical and demographic data of patients along with their diabetes status (positive or negative). The dataset includes features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level.

## Analysis
The project involves exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the construction of machine learning models to predict diabetes risk. Various classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient-Boosted Trees, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Linear SVC are employed to model the relationship between predictor variables and diabetes status.

## Hypotheses
Several hypotheses are tested during the analysis, including:
- Higher BMI is positively correlated with diabetes risk.
- Elevated HbA1c levels are indicative of diabetes risk.
- Elevated fasting blood glucose levels are indicative of diabetes risk.

## Results
The project evaluates the performance of different machine learning models in predicting diabetes risk and provides insights into the association between predictor variables and diabetes status. Performance metrics such as accuracy and F1 score are used to assess model performance.
